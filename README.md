    if err := server.ServeStdio(s); err != nil {
        fmt.Printf("Server error: %v\n", err)
    }
}

func helloHandler(ctx context.Context, arguments map[string]interface{}) (*mcp.CallToolResult, error) {
    name, ok := arguments["name"].(string)
    if !ok {
        return mcp.NewToolResultError("name must be a string"), nil
    }

    return mcp.NewToolResultText(fmt.Sprintf("Hello, %s!", name)), nil
}
```

That's it!

MCP Go handles all the complex protocol details and server management, so you can focus on building great tools. It aims to be high-level and easy to use.

### Key features:
* **Fast**: High-level interface means less code and faster development
* **Simple**: Build MCP servers with minimal boilerplate
* **Complete***: MCP Go aims to provide a full implementation of the core MCP specification

(\*emphasis on *aims*)

üö® üöß üèóÔ∏è *MCP Go is under active development, as is the MCP specification itself. Core features are working but some advanced capabilities are still in progress.*

## Installation

```bash
go get github.com/mark3labs/mcp-go
```

## Quickstart

Let's create a simple MCP server that exposes a calculator tool and some data:

```go
// TODO
```
## What is MCP?

The [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) lets you build servers that expose data and functionality to LLM applications in a secure, standardized way. Think of it like a web API, but specifically designed for LLM interactions. MCP servers can:

- Expose data through **Resources** (think of these sort of like GET endpoints; they are used to load information into the LLM's context)
- Provide functionality through **Tools** (sort of like POST endpoints; they are used to execute code or otherwise produce a side effect)
- Define interaction patterns through **Prompts** (reusable templates for LLM interactions)
- And more!


## Core Concepts


### Server

The server is your core interface to the MCP protocol. It handles connection management, protocol compliance, and message routing:

```go
// TODO
```

### Resources

Resources are how you expose data to LLMs. They're similar to GET endpoints in a REST API - they provide data but shouldn't perform significant computation or have side effects. Some examples:

- File contents
- Database schemas
- API responses
- System information

Resources can be static:
```go
// TODO
```

### Tools

Tools let LLMs take actions through your server. Unlike resources, tools are expected to perform computation and have side effects. They're similar to POST endpoints in a REST API.

Simple calculation example:
```go
// TODO
```

HTTP request example:
```go
// TODO
```

### Prompts

Prompts are reusable templates that help LLMs interact with your server effectively. They're like "best practices" encoded into your server. A prompt can be as simple as a string:

```go
// TODO
```

Or a more structured sequence of messages:
```go
// TODO
```

## Examples

For examples, see the `examples/` directory.

Go version >= 1.23

### Installation

Create a fork of this repository, then clone it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mark3labs/mcp-go.git
cd mcp-go
```

### Testing

Please make sure to test any new functionality. Your tests should be simple and atomic and anticipate change rather than cement complex patterns.

Run tests from the root directory:

```bash
go test -v './...'
```
